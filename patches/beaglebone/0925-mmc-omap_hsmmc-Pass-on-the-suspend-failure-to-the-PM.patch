Subject: [PATCH 0925/1092] mmc: omap_hsmmc: Pass on the suspend failure to
 the PM core

In some cases mmc_host_suspend() is not able to claim the
host and proceed with the suspend process. The core returns
-EBUSY to the host controller driver. Unfortunately, the
host controller driver does not pass on this information
to the PM core and hence the system suspend process continues.

In these cases the MMC core gets to an unexpected state
during resume and multiple issues related to MMC crop up.
1. Host controller driver starts accessing the device registers
before the clocks are enabled which leads to a prefetch abort.
2. A file copy thread which was launched before suspend gets
stuck due to the host not being reclaimed during resume.

To avoid such problems pass on the -EBUSY status to the PM core
from the host controller driver. With this change, MMC core
suspend might still fail but it does not end up making the
system unusable. Suspend gets aborted and the user can try
suspending the system again.
