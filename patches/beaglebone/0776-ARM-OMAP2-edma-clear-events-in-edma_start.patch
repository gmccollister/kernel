Subject: [PATCH 0776/1092] ARM: OMAP2+: edma: clear events in edma_start()

This patch fixes an issue where a DMA channel can erroneously process an
event generated by a previous transfer.  A failure case is where DMA is
being used for SPI transmit and receive channels on OMAP L138.  In this
case there is a single bit that controls all event generation from the
SPI peripheral.  Therefore it is possible that between when edma_stop()
has been called for the transmit channel on a previous transfer and
edma_start() is called for the transmit channel on a subsequent
transfer, that a transmit event has been generated.

The fix is to clear events in edma_start().  This prevents false events
from being processed when events are enabled for that channel.
